# Features

To get to the best chances to win, Suntzu will provide two main features :

## Map metrics

Map metrics is the first feature implemented.  
With it, you will automatically collect all the statistics you want to make the best decisions !  
Matches, winrates, average kills, headshots, k/d or k/r, there's nothing you won't be warned about.  
For each map card in the matchroom, you will know everything that is needed to chose wich map to play or wich map to avoid.

## Player metrics

Player metrics is currently still in workout.  
For each map in the matchroom, you will soon know everything about your mates.  
Should you place them as lurker ? As entry ?  
Can they stay alone on B site while you are pushing somewhere else in the map ?  
Player metrics will surely answer all these questions, letting you having the high ground over your opponents !

## Yet to come

Some nice ideas are still at draft stage and will arrive in a near future.
