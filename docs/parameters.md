# Parameters

In Suntzu, you can set up 3 different parameters that will change drastically your opponent's stats.  
Indeed, you may want to consider the very few recent matches of your opponents instead of their 6 months ago played games.  
However, being used to those parameters give you many informations, like if your opponents use to be strong in certain maps during the age.

## Match

This first option will set up the number of matches used to sort the statistics you're looking for each players.  
By 10, 20, 50 or 100, you'll define more precisely if your opponents are strong for a long time or if they improved themselves recently.  
By default, this option is set up to 100 matches.

## Time

This option will set-up the period that will be used to gather all the statistics needed.  
By 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months or 6 months, you'll once again be able to understand how strong and consistent are your opponents.  
By default, this option is set to 3 months.

## Player

This option will define how many players of your opponents should have played in the games you want to consider for your statistics.  
This way, you'll understand if your opponents use or lack to play together, making you able to select the best maps you want for your team.  
The options available are : any, min:2 , min:3, min:4 or all.  
With "any', you will NOT consider your opponents as a team when collecting their stats but will get everything raw, showing how strong are your opponents one by one in their team.
With "all", you will ask Suntzu to consider only the games played as 5 to get more precise statistics.
