# Getting Started

## What is Suntzu ?

Suntzu is an easy-to-install extension for your favorite browser.  
With it, you'll easily enhance your Faceit games by automatically getting statistics about all the players of the game.  
Thereby, you'll have everything you need to take the best decisions on which map to play on... and wich role to take !

## What does Suntzu look like ?

Suntzu will take his seat directly in your browser, at the map vote.  
You will see a bunch of statistics under the maps that are voted with clear colors to easily understand wich map to play, or wich map to avoid.  
You can also refine some stats of your choice to be sure to take the best decision !
